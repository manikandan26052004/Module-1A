# Experiment No: 1a Python Basics- Printing Integer Literals

## AIM  
To Write a python program to print the following integer literals.

## ALGORITHM  
Start the program.

Use the print() function to directly print the integer 123_456_789.

Note: The underscore _ is used for better readability but does not affect the actual value.

The output will display 123456789 without underscores.

End the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212222220022
# Name- Manikandan R
# Write your code here

# Optimized Python program to print an integer literal
print(123_456_789)

```
